# ENGINEERING-INNOVATION-PROJECT
This project is a Python program that sends rain condition notifications to users via email and WhatsApp. The program runs on a cloud server and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data in real-time. Users can configure the program to receive notifications at specific times of the day and set up custom notification preferences.

The program makes use of Python's SMTP and Twilio modules to send emails and WhatsApp messages, respectively. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for users to configure their notification preferences, and allows for customization of notification content and frequency.
